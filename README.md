# SLAM-Project

  Mr. Tian and I worked together to build this project with Kinect. We build this prototype project of RGB-D SLAM just for practicing. 
  In this project, we use OpenNI, OpenCV-3.0, Eigen, PCL and G2O.  For convenient, we provide a script for installing these packages. You will find it in another repository.
  We will keep update this project.
  Thank you!
